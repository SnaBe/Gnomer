# Gnomer
> A World of Warcraft Classic addon.

## General information
Enhances the experience of playing as a Gnome by giving you access to a large sum of Gnome jokes.

This addon was made for a friend of mine, who happens to play as a Gnome in Classic.

If you wish to install this addon on your own machine, here's how:

First, [download or clone this repository](https://github.com/SnaBe/Gnomer).

Second navigate to where your World of Warcraft Classic is installed.

In my case it is: `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_\Interface\AddOns\`

Third, drag the downloaded zip file to that directory above and extract the file contents.

**Note:** If you have WoW running you'll need to restart it.

Boom! You'll now be able out Gnome your fellow players!

## So how does it work?

Simple type /gnome help in a chat window and the addon will guide you trough its process.

## Additional information

**Note:** The addon is only active when you're playing as a Gnome.
